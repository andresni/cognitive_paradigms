Some paradigms in python

1) Global Local paradigm. Study ERP responses to global and local auditory deviants. Integrated with BrainProducts eeg system. Based on:
Bekinschtein, T. A., Dehaene, S., Rohaut, B., Tadel, F., Cohen, L., & Naccache, L. (2009). Neural signature of the conscious processing of auditory regularities. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106(5), 1672-1677.

2) Subjects Own Name paradigm. Study ERP responses to a participants own name versus other names. Integrated with BrainProducts eeg system. Based on:
Perrin, F., Garcı́a-Larrea, L., Mauguière, F., & Bastuji, H. (1999). A differential brain response to the subject's own name persists during sleep. Clinical Neurophysiology, 110(12), 2153-2164.

3) A rapid visual stimulus response task, to load attentional resources. Based on: 
Bekinschtein, T. A., Dehaene, S., Rohaut, B., Tadel, F., Cohen, L., & Naccache, L. (2009). Neural signature of the conscious processing of auditory regularities. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106(5), 1672-1677.

4) A working memory task, designed to load on attentional and working memory processing resources. Own design.
