% Use this file to define some parameters
% Importantly, the duration of time intervals should be in seconds
%   - MAXRT: maximum latency of a response
%   - FIX: presentation duration of fixation cross between trials
%   - SPT: presentation duration of the signal
%   - PAUSETM: how many seconds for the break
%   - SSD: jitterfactor - 1=0-1000ms, 2=0-500ms, 10=0-99ms, etc
%   - NBLOCKS: the number of trials/6 - 1/6 of the number of trials you want.
%               you get 1.5 stop trials per NBLOCKS you have.
%   - PRIOR: On windows, There are 3 priority levels available,
%            levels 0, 1, and 2. Level 0 is "normal priority level", level 1 is "high
%            priority level", and level 2 is "real time priority level"
% Separate the parameter and the value with a white space
% Jitter thingy thingy yes - use for variable difficulty as well!!
